      <h3>We are helping!</h3>
      <p>Aalborg Zoo participates in several projects to preserve animal and plant life worldwide.
        Zoo cooperates with organizations to make an effort wherever there is a need for help.
        The conservation of habitats is extremely important and for a sustainable solution, it needs to be done in cooperation with local populations<br>

      <p><b>
        A group of 26 local women operating in Balule in South Africa. Black Mamba is protection against snipers and poachers.</b> </p>
		<p class="visible_text">Balule is a 400 km2 large part of the world-renowned Kruger National Park.
            
            It is our conviction that the war against poachers can't be won by bullets, but through the education of the community.
            This is where these women make a significant difference.
            Culturally speaking, they have a much greater credibility than men.
            The illegal hunting of the wild animals in Africa has exploded throughout the last decade.
            Especially the elephants and rhinos are very hard hit.
            So hard that the trade in endangered species today is considered the world's fourth largest criminal economy.
            In less than 2 years, Black Mamba has reduced the poaching in their area by<b> 76%.</b> </p>
