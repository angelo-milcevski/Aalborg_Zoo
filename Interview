1. Do you consider yourself as a person who is influenced by images or stories of animals connected to any kind of donation? 

  	I think I am… It is different to see, for example, a baby lion, that needs help, from, I don’t know…alligator. 

2. If the donation form is too complicated and long (takes more than 2 minutes and include registration or e-mail confirmation.) 
are you still willing to donate? 

  	Well, If I would be really decided that I want to donate that it is okay to spend some time on it, I guess. 
    But I really don’t like filling out the questions-forms. 

3. Would you like to see a range of payment options as well as your own option?

	  It would be good to have some prepared options to just click on.
